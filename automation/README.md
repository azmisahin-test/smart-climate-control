This section details the automation logic for notifications and actions based on sensor data.

## Setup
1. Define the thresholds for alerts (e.g., high temperature).
2. Set up email or messaging nodes for notifications.

## Node-RED Flow
- Use function nodes to check conditions.
- Use notification nodes to send alerts when conditions are met.
