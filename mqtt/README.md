# MQTT Integration

This section covers the integration of MQTT for collecting temperature and humidity data from sensors.

## Setup
1. Install an MQTT broker (e.g., Mosquitto).
2. Connect your sensors to the broker.

## Node-RED Flow
- Use the MQTT input node to subscribe to the sensor data topic.
- Process the incoming data as needed.
