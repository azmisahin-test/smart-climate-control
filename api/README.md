# Weather API Integration

This section describes how to integrate an external weather API to fetch current weather conditions.

## Setup
1. Sign up for an API key from a weather service (e.g., OpenWeatherMap).
2. Create an HTTP request in Node-RED to fetch weather data.

## Node-RED Flow
- Use the HTTP request node to get data from the API.
- Parse the response to extract temperature and weather conditions.
